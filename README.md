# trainwreck 3 


Coding challenge 3... 
I wrote it mostly. But then I worked on it too long and got all deep thinky.

the more i thought about this the more I thought this wasn't the correct approach.
Nor one that the original coders would have used. I feel this way because of the 'food'
The food needs to fall in the 'grid' and not where the snake has been. I also believe programmers
of the Basic language would be thinking on more of a grid/array/matrix than in the more free 
world of Processing/flash/or Canvas(JS)

So this time I'm going to try this gridded matrix style instead. 

create a grid and move around it with arrows.  add length to snake.  and food generation. 

I can then worry about constraints.  and food generation. 


//update
ok i no longer feel this is they way they would have done this... I feel this has only overcomplicated the whole architecture. I really need to refactor BUT I'm going to continue down this path for now.
